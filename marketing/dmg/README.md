# kurtz installer artwork

The installer uses the owner's Graphite/Ivory/Electric Yellow palette, the exact
vector wordmark, Sora, and the claim “Good videos go further.” Its softly lit curl
illustration was generated with the built-in Imagegen tool; the original is
`kurtz-background-art.png`. `build-kurtz-dmg.cjs` composes the checked-in vector
mark and font over that artwork. `background.svg` and `background@2x.png` are the
reproducible 1536 × 1024 source and Finder background.

Finder draws the real app icon and Applications link. No fake app UI is baked
into the background. The window is 768 × 512 points, with 112-point icons at
(244, 216) and (524, 216). Only `kurtz.app` and `Applications` are visible.
License/source records stay under `.licenses`; the app exposes its notices too.
The signed app is never modified when styling the volume.

Rebuild with the build-only environment containing `Tools/kurtz/dmg-requirements.txt`:

```sh
node Tools/marketing/build-kurtz-dmg.cjs
build/dmg-tools/bin/python Tools/kurtz/package-dmg.py \
  build/release/0.9.7/notarized/kurtz.app \
  --output build/release/0.9.7/installer
```

The packager requires a universal, Developer-ID-signed app with a stapled ticket
for production and refuses to overwrite an existing output. Legacy artwork and
release images remain in Git history and the original release artifacts.

The original Vela prompts are preserved verbatim in `archive-vela/`. They are
historical provenance; current illustration instructions are in `kurtz-art-prompt.txt`.
