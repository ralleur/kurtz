# kurtz

Good videos go further. A free, independent Swiftfin fork by Ralleur for Mac,
iPhone/iPad and Apple TV. The product name is always lowercase.

The Mac app opens local video files and Jellyfin libraries. It includes recent
files/resume, audio/subtitle selection, external subtitles, speed, fullscreen,
a floating mini player, language presets and metadata-based episode prompts.
VLC is the default local engine; mpv is available as an alternative. Compatibility
depends on the media and platform. Episode prompts require server metadata.

The current Mac beta is **0.9.7 (9)**. Mobile/TV source builds remain release
preparation, without a public App Store or TestFlight release.

  their version claims and old commands are not the current release procedure.

`com.ralleur.vela` and `com.ralleur.vela.mac`, existing preference/keychain keys
and `vela://` are retained so the rename keeps installations and sign-ins intact.
New links use `kurtz://`. The Mac installer contains `kurtz.app` on volume `kurtz`.

## Maintenance

Owned additions live in `Shared/Kurtz`, `Swiftfin/Kurtz` and `Swiftfin tvOS/Kurtz`.
`Tools/kurtz` contains build/release tools; `Tools/KurtzLogicTests` contains the
46 focused playback and product-logic tests. The Xcode project and schemes keep
Swiftfin's engineering names. The active local checkout keeps its compatibility
path; the public repository is `ralleur/kurtz`.

The existing monthly integration automation retains its schedule and permissions.
It selects the penultimate stable Swiftfin release, works in a separate worktree,
and requires all original build/runtime checks before merging its PR.
